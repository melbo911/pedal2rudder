# pedal2rudder

"pedal2rudder" is a little lua script which can be used together with the "FlyWithLua" plugin in the X-Plane flight simulator. The script can map the 2 pedals "clutch" and "brake" or "accelerator" of a racing pedal set into one "yaw" / "rudder" axis.

If you're flying mostly helicopters ( like me ) you might want to engage the parking brake permanently. To do so, set the variable "use_brakes = 0" in the script.


# Installation

Simply copy the script to the "X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts" folder. Then map the "clutch" pedal as "left toe brake" and the "accelerator" pedal as "right toe brake". The script will then map them to the rudder or tail rotor.


# Uninstall

Just delete the sccript from the "X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts" folder.
